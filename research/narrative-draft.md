# Narrative Draft (Verified)

This narrative is limited to OCR-backed facts listed in `docs/facts-verified.md`. It is safe to use for public copy once the OCR snippets are manually confirmed against the original scans.

## The Property, Placed on the Map

The legal description in the 2013 deed situates the property on the **south side of Pine Street**, beginning **230 feet west of Eighteenth Street**, with **22 feet of frontage** and a **90-foot depth to Waverly Street**. This anchors the house not just by address but by its lot geometry and its long rear boundary to Waverly.

## The 1890s: Loss and Change

A death notice dated April 23, 1891 reports **Spencer Jr.** died at **1822 Pine Street** of **scarlet fever**, with the age listed as 7 years. Two years later, a Philadelphia Inquirer clipping titled **"1822 Sold for $14,000"** (May 11, 1893) documents the property changing hands in the public record.

## The 1899 Renovation Moment

In July 1899, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports that **Duhring, Okie & Ziegler** finished plans for **alterations and additions** to **Mrs. Graham Spencer's residence at 1822 Pine Street**. An August 1899 Philadelphia Times notice reports the same architectural firm awarded a contract for **alterations and additions** to the residence of **Mrs. Agnes Spencer at 1822 Pine Street**, with a reported cost of **about $6,000**.

## 1901: Society Life Returns

The Philadelphia Inquirer describes the **Rolin-Plumb wedding**, noting that the **breakfast was served at the residence of the bride's parents on Pine Street** (OCR reads \"IS22 Pine street\" and should be manually confirmed). In a separate social listing, the Philadelphia Times notes **Mrs. Graham Spencer** closed her country house at **Kaolin, Chester County** and **returned to 1822 Pine Street for the winter**.

## 1904-1905: Social Calendar and Improvements

A December 1904 Inquirer listing records an **"At home"** for **Mrs. Henry C. Davis and the Misses Davis** at **1822 Pine Street**. In August 1905, a notice lists a **fireplace job at 1822 Pine Street** with a **cost of $130**.

## 1915: Civic Activity at the Address

In January 1915, the Evening Public Ledger notes that **Equal Franchise Society luncheon tickets** were available from **treasurer Miss Martha Davis at 1822 Pine Street**, with **covers priced at $1.50**. The address appears explicitly as the point of contact.

## Modern Documentation

A 2002 deed form lists the property address as **1822 Pine Street**. A 2022 property certificate lists the **property address**, **zoning classification RM1**, **issue date 03/30/2022**, and **five (5) dwelling units**, confirming modern legal use and registration data.

## Gaps and Next Verification Targets

The OCR-backed narrative above is only a fraction of the available archive. The following items still need manual review and transcription before they can be treated as verified facts:

- 1854 deed abstract details (names, consideration, construction claims)
- Additional newspaper clippings not yet OCR-transcribed
- Architectural attributions beyond the 1899 notices

See:
- `docs/transcriptions-ocr.md` for draft OCR text
- `docs/unverified-claims.md` for catalog claims that need verification
- `docs/document-gallery.md` for the full source list
