# Chapter 1 — Before the Threshold (1820s–1850s)

*I was a slab of white marble when the mason bedded me into Pine Street—cool under dust and hooves. Boots creaked; a housemaid's broom ticked across my edge. By afternoon the rhythm appeared: tradesmen early, callers after three, a card left on the hall table, a door that knew exactly how wide to open for each.*

## A house built for ritual

The form is classic **Philadelphia side‑hall**—tall brick, paired front parlors, stairs rising in a quiet arc. The lot runs back to **Waverly Street**, where service once entered; that geometry still dictates how **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com) works for caterers and crews today.

Builder‑developer **John McCrea**, a prolific hand in the west‑of‑Broad streetscape, put up blocks of dignified red‑brick townhouses in the 1840s–50s. **1822 Pine** belongs to that campaign: a refined façade in late **Greek Revival** moving toward **Italianate**, high ceilings and marble mantels within—"Proper Philadelphia" in brick and stone.

**Provenance anchor:** In **April 1854** the newly built house and lot were sold by **John McCrea** to **John Roset**, a merchant of French parentage; the transaction begins the continuous, documentable story of this address [@deed_1854_abstract].

## The Rosets: first long tenure

**John and Mary Ann (Laning) Roset** brought the first long thread of family life to the rooms—children, callers, winter dinners. Their eldest daughter **Ellen** had already married the young banker **Anthony J. Drexel** (1850), a connection repeated in period notices and later summaries; **1822 Pine** became the city address of a family knitted into Philadelphia's mercantile and philanthropic elite.

When **John Roset** died in **1870**, **Mary Ann** kept the house; at her death (**1880**) it passed into **trust** with the Pennsylvania Company, a decision that likely meant the property was **rented out in the 1880s** while children and grandchildren ranged elsewhere in the city.

## What life looked—and felt—like (c. 1845–1859)

* **Dress & movement.** Silk dresses widened as the decade turned; men in sober frock coats moved easily through the side‑hall. The parlors were the stage: receiving days, musical evenings, weddings at home, wakes too—every ritual framed by the same doorways now available for your *Philadelphia historic venue rental* at **therittenhouseresidence.com**.

* **Staff & service.** In a house this size, expect **cook + housemaid**, with a **coachman** or **boy** for errands, sleeping high or rear; coal scuttles and the clink of hot water cans mapped the day's labor.

* **Seasons.** **Winters "in town"** filled the calendar; **summers** meant a lightened household—shutters, a caretaker, letters posted from the shore while the marble step warmed in blue July.

These paragraphs paint the world; the address‑specific facts remain tethered to the records above.

### What to Notice Today

* **Circulation that tells time.** The side‑hall funnels callers and crews with the same efficiency now as then—an argument for **event flow** at *The Rittenhouse Residence*.
* **Parlor pair.** Stand midway and imagine chairs pulled back for a wedding breakfast. The proportions are not decorative—they're functional hospitality, perfect for today's *Rittenhouse Square wedding venue* needs.

## Provenance (show‑your‑work lines)

* **1854** — **McCrea → Roset** deed; first long‑term owners in place
* **c. 1840s–50s** — House type & fabric (Greek Revival to Italianate; high ceilings; marble mantels) ascribed to McCrea's campaigns west of Broad
* **Estate/trust** — Upon **Mary Ann Roset's** death (**1880**), the house enters trust management
* **Service geometry** — Lot running back to **Waverly Street**; rear‑service logic still legible

## Then‑vs‑Now: Sleeping Capacity

* **Today:** sleeps **16** comfortably (**18** with sofa‑bed)—ideal for *family reunions, micro‑weddings, corporate retreats,* and *film crews* at **therittenhouseresidence.com**
* **c. 1855 (Roset years):** likely **8–10** nightly (parents + 3–4 children + 2–3 live‑in staff), with room to stretch to **10–12** during winter gatherings
