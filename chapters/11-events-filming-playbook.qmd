# Chapter 11 — Events & Filming (Playbook & Floor‑Flow)

*Feet arrive with intent now: planners with clipboards, a director's quiet shoes, bridesmaids carrying steam. I feel the house choose the right shapes for them—one room for promise, one for talk, the back way for work. The old geometry holds: ceremony in front, effort along Waverly, celebration in between.*

## Why this house *works* for events and shoots

The original **side‑hall + double‑parlor** plan was drawn for orchestrated hospitality—callers on schedule, food and service kept discreet. That same geometry, plus the **service run to Waverly Street**, makes today's weddings, retreats, and productions run cleanly—with guests flowing at the front and vendors loading at the rear.

* **Public to private:** Street → Side‑hall (welcome) → First Parlor (ceremony/briefing) → Second Parlor (reception/green room) → Dining & Garden (service hinge) → **Waverly** (quiet load‑in/out)
* **Sleeps now:** **16** comfortably (**18** with a sofa‑bed), per your current setup—ideal for **family reunions**, **micro‑weddings**, **corporate off‑sites**, and **multi‑day shoots** listed at **therittenhouseresidence.com** (with **1822Pine.com** redirect)
* **Historic integrity, modern utility:** The core fabric dates to the **mid‑19th century**, with a **documented 1899 "alterations & additions"** by **Duhring, Okie & Ziegler** [@deed_1899_abstract]—a provenance line you can print on call sheets and in venue decks

The same parlors that hosted the Rolin-Plumb wedding breakfast in 1901 [@news_1901_plumb_wedding] and Mrs. Davis's "At Homes" in 1904 [@news_1904_davis_athome] now welcome your celebrations at **The Rittenhouse Residence**.

## Floor‑Flow Playbook (three common setups)

### A) Micro‑wedding (30–50 for ceremony; intimate dinner afterward)

1. **Welcome:** Side‑hall (escort cards on hall table; photos on the marble stoop)
2. **Ceremony:** First Parlor (chairs facing the street windows; musicians tucked by the 1905 fireplace [@news_1905_fireplace])
3. **Cocktail:** Second Parlor; bar staged near garden‑facing door
4. **Dinner:** Dining room + parlor tables; garden for toasts if weather allows
5. **Vendor path:** **Waverly** corridor for all BOH traffic; kitchen staging out of guest sightlines

### B) Corporate off‑site (board + breakouts)

1. **Plenary:** First Parlor in boardroom or U‑shape; simple mobile A/V
2. **Breakouts:** Second Parlor and Dining; "phone zone" in the hall bench area
3. **Catering:** Rear corridor; rolling service via **Waverly**
4. **Evening:** Fireside conversation by the 1905 fireplace; light terrace/garden use as weather allows

### C) Filming / Stills

1. **Tech scout:** Identify power access per room; protect mantels/floors; confirm rigging policy
2. **Talent holding / HMU:** Second Parlor; wardrobe in dining; steamer in rear corridor
3. **Load‑in:** All carts and cases via **Waverly**; lay runners at thresholds; keep front hall photogenic
4. **Noise & neighborliness:** Treat the façade like a set—stage quietly, mind sightlines on Pine

> *Capacity notes are presented as use‑case guidance rather than code statements; you'll confirm final headcounts with your caterer and city rules for the date and scope.*

## House Rules that protect fabric (venue‑ready)

* **Protect the marble** (front & garden thresholds) with low‑profile mats during load‑in
* **No adhesive on plaster or mantels;** use freestanding or clamp‑on solutions with pads
* **Candles:** contained only; no open flame near mantels or draperies
* **Music & hours:** follow city noise guidance; wrap front‑of‑house activity on schedule
* **Insurance & COIs:** request a current **COI naming the owner/LLC as AI**; require vendors to carry standard limits and list the **address** precisely as **1822 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19103**
* **Historic district context:** Exterior setups must respect the **Rittenhouse‑Fitler Residential Historic District** standards (1995)

### What to Notice Today

* **The "invisible highway."** Follow the rear corridor to **Waverly** and you're tracing the 19th‑century service path—today's catering and crew lane
* **Parlor sightlines.** One axis = ceremony aisle, runway, or dolly track; the other = bar, breakout, or B‑camera
* **Historic moments.** The same rooms that saw Howard Spencer Jr.'s wake (1891), suffrage organizing (1915), and medical consultations (1915-1916) now host your events

## For Guests

* Ask to see where the **card tray** sat—the social software that made Philadelphia winters hum
* Try the **stoop shot**: every wedding album wants one great Pine Street frame
* Consider that your celebration joins a 170-year tradition in these parlors

## For Buyers

* **Proven adaptability:** residential, salon, **professional office (1915–1916)**, apartments mid‑century, and today's venue use—continuity that underwrites value
* **Provenance lines to print:** **1854 McCrea→Roset** [@deed_1854_abstract], **1899 DO&Z**, **1911 suffrage**, **1915 activism** [@news_1915_suffrage], **1995 district**—an unusually clean paper trail
* **Revenue diversity:** Wedding venue, corporate retreats, film location, luxury rental—multiple income streams from one property
