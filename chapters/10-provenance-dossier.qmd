# Chapter 10 — Provenance Dossier (Reproducible, Address‑Anchored Lines)

*I am made of dates as much as brick. I learned the calendar by the weight of footsteps—the day the mason left, the winter the doctor hung a shingle, the spring a tax bill arrived with a principle attached. Here are the moments you can hold up like a lantern and say: it happened here.*
