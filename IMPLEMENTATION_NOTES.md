## 🚨 ACTION REQUIRED (Next Steps for You)

### 1. **Set Up Google Analytics** (15 minutes)
1. Go to https://analytics.google.com
2. Create new property for "The Rittenhouse Residence"
3. Get your GA4 Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
4. Edit `website/_quarto.yml` line 77-78
5. Uncomment and replace the placeholder ID with your real one

### 2. **Update Review Content with Real Data** (1-2 hours)
The testimonials page (`website/testimonials.qmd`) currently has sample/template reviews. You should:
1. Export real reviews from Airbnb (go to your listing, click Reviews, export)
2. Export real reviews from VRBO
3. Replace the sample content with actual guest quotes
4. Use real guest names (first name + last initial) if permitted
5. Keep the same formatting/structure

### 3. **Verify Booking Links Still Work** (5 minutes)
Test all booking links to ensure they go to the right places:
- Airbnb: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6000930
- VRBO: https://www.vrbo.com/757481

### 4. **Set Up Google Search Console** (30 minutes)
1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add your property: therittenhouseresidence.com
3. Verify ownership (Netlify makes this easy)
4. Submit your sitemap: https://therittenhouseresidence.com/sitemap.xml
5. Request indexing for key pages

### 5. **Create Social Media Accounts** (if not already done)
The site references:
- Instagram: @therittenhouseresidence
- Facebook: The Rittenhouse Residence

If these don't exist yet, create them or update the links in `website/_quarto.yml` lines 70-71

### 6. **Optional: Add Real Photos to Compare Page** (1 hour)
The comparison page would be even better with:
- Photos of typical hotel rooms vs your suites
- Screenshots of hotel pricing
- Before/after renovation photos
