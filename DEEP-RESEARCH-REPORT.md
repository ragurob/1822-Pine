## I. THE BUILDER: JOHN McCREA

### Verified Facts

| Fact | Source |
|------|--------|
| John McCrea was a former shipping magnate with one of Philadelphia's largest fleets in the 1820s-1830s | Hidden City Philadelphia |
| McCrea became one of the most prolific Rittenhouse real estate developers | Hidden City Philadelphia |
| McCrea owned property on nearly every block of Spruce, Delancey, and Pine Streets west of 17th Street | Hidden City Philadelphia |
| McCrea's early projects included the 1700 blocks of Pine and Addison Streets | Living Places |
| McCrea developed both sides of the 1800 and 2000 blocks of Delancey | Living Places |
| McCrea used builders and master carpenters rather than architects | Hidden City Philadelphia |
| The Joshua Husband House (1801 Delancey) was built by McCrea in 1857 | Hidden City Philadelphia |
| The McCrea brothers built 2000-2018 Delancey Place in 1865-1866 | Philly Mag |
| Joseph McCrea (one of three brothers) was a physician who lived at 2004 Delancey | Philly Mag |

### Biography

- **Former Occupation**: Shipping magnate with one of the largest fleets in Philadelphia port (1820s-1830s)
- **Transition**: Real estate development in mid-19th century
- **Business Partners**: Worked with his brothers on speculative housing
- **Approach**: Used builders and master carpenters rather than architects, resulting in "reduced costs, but somewhat outdated styles"
- **Style**: Built houses "to suit the conservative tastes of Proper Philadelphians"

### Research Gap

Direct documentation linking John McCrea specifically to 1822 Pine Street in 1854 was **not found** in online sources. However, given that:
- McCrea's early projects included the 1700 block of Pine Street
- McCrea owned property on "nearly every block" of Pine Street west of 17th
- The building date (1854) and style match McCrea's documented work

The attribution is highly plausible but requires archival verification through:
- Philadelphia deed records (1840s-1850s)
- McElroy's Philadelphia City Directory (1854-1860)
- Philadelphia Athenaeum architectural archives

## II. THE ROSET FAMILY (1854-1880)

### John Roset Biography

- **Death:** August 8, 1870
- **Occupation:** Merchant
- **Family Background:** Son/grandson of Jean Jacques Rozet (1764/65-1850), a French-Hungarian immigrant and successful dry goods merchant

### Mary Ann Laning Roset

- **Birth:** c. 1807
- **Death:** 1880
- **Children:** Five documented children:
  1. **Ellen Bicking Rozet** (February 21, 1829 - November 27, 1891) - married Anthony J. Drexel
  2. **George Hollenback Roset** (February 21, 1829 - November 15, 1900) - Ellen's twin
  3. **Mary Ann Ludlow** (born Roset)
  4. **Elizabeth Virginia Brodhead** (born Roset)
  5. **Sarah Emily Phelps/Smith** (January 28, 1839 - March 28, 1903)

### The Drexel Connection - FULLY VERIFIED

**Ellen Bicking Rozet married Anthony Joseph Drexel on August 13, 1850** in Philadelphia. The marriage was officiated by Rev. John D. Ludlow, Provost of the University of Pennsylvania.

**Anthony Joseph Drexel (1826-1893)** was:

## III. THE SPENCER FAMILY (1890s)

### CRITICAL CORRECTION

The original documentation contains a **significant name error**. Research indicates:

| Claimed | Evidence Found |
|---------|----------------|
| Howard Spencer (patriarch) | **Graham Spencer (1852-1896)** per Find a Grave |
| Howard Spencer Jr. (son, died 1891) | Howard Spencer (1884-1891) **VERIFIED** |
| Howard Spencer died June 28, 1896 | **Graham Spencer** died 1896 |

The father appears to have been **Graham Spencer**, not Howard Spencer. "Howard" was the name of the son who died in 1891.

### Verified: The 1891 Tragedy

**Find a Grave Memorial #74603329** confirms:
- **Howard Spencer** was born February 26, 1884
- **Died April 20, 1891** (aged 7)
- Buried at **Laurel Hill Cemetery, Section E, Plot 37-48**
- Parents: **Graham Spencer (1852-1896)** and **Agnes Mary Smith Spencer (1862-1921)**

The date and age at death match the documented claims exactly. The cause of death as scarlet fever is consistent with the existing newspaper clipping but requires verification against the original source.

### Historical Context

Scarlet fever was prevalent in 1890s Philadelphia:
- Case-fatality rates in Philadelphia (1897): 11.8% overall, 21.8% for children ages 1-5
- The disease primarily affected children ages 5-15

### Agnes M. Spencer

The Philadelphia Architects and Buildings database confirms **Agnes Spencer** as a client for residential work on the 1800 block of Pine Street. This supports her role as property owner after her husband's death.

### Recommendations

1. Correct the patriarch's name from "Howard Spencer" to "Graham Spencer" throughout documentation
2. Verify the June 1896 death date against Graham Spencer records
3. Request official Laurel Hill Cemetery records for the Spencer family plot

## IV. THE DAVIS FAMILY AND SUFFRAGE (1904-1918)

### Verified Facts

| Claim | Status | Evidence |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Henry C. Davis and Naomi Lawton Davis lived at 1822 Pine Street | **VERIFIED** | December 28, 1913 newspaper: "Mrs. Henry C. Davis of 1822 Pine street" |
| Davis family "At Home" receptions (1904) | **VERIFIED** | Philadelphia Inquirer, December 11, 1904 |
| Tax resistance activism | **VERIFIED** | December 1913 (not 1911 as claimed) |
| Martha Davis sold Equal Franchise tickets (January 8, 1915) | **VERIFIED** | Evening Public Ledger, January 8, 1915, p. 10 |
| Naomi Lawton Davis died May 21, 1918 | **DOCUMENTED** | Project sources cite obituary text |

### Date Correction

The tax resistance is documented as **December 1913**, not 1911:

From Tax Resistance in the U.S. Women's Suffrage Movement archives:
> Mrs. Henry C. Davis of 1822 Pine Street responded to Dr. Anna Howard Shaw's December 1913 call for women to refuse income taxes, stating: "It's the same principle against which my forbears protested. They didn't have to levy a war tax, because the Quakers didn't believe in war. Resistance to taxation without representation has my entire sympathy."

### Context: Philadelphia Suffrage Movement

- **Anna Howard Shaw** (1847-1919) was president of NAWSA 1904-1915
- In December 1913, she launched a national "passive resistance" campaign
- The **Equal Franchise Society of Philadelphia** was established in 1909
- **Caroline Katzenstein** served as executive secretary 1914-1916
- A state suffrage referendum was defeated in Pennsylvania in 1915

## V. DUHRING, OKIE & ZIEGLER

### Firm History - VERIFIED

### 1822 Pine Street Commission - UNVERIFIED

Despite extensive searching, **no independent documentation** was found confirming:
- A specific 1899 commission at 1822 Pine Street
- The $25,000 renovation cost
- Architectural drawings or permits

**However:** The timing (1899) aligns with the firm's founding year, and a $25,000 renovation (~$900,000 today) would be consistent with a major townhouse renovation for a wealthy Rittenhouse Square client.

### Recommendations for Verification

1. Philadelphia City Archives - building permits from 1899
2. Athenaeum of Philadelphia - architectural drawings
3. Pennsylvania State Archives - Brognard Okie Architectural Papers (MG-303)
4. University of Pennsylvania Architectural Archives

- Georgie Rodgers Plumb (1879-1906) - age 22 in 1901
