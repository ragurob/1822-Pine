# Chapter 8 — Back to a Single‑Family Grande Dame (1995–present)

*Scaffolds went up and I learned a new patience—the measured breath of careful work. Hammers spoke a different language now: not demolition, but repair. When the paper was signed that marked the district lines, I felt it in the gentler way people touched the stone.*

## Recognition, protection, revival

In **1995**, **1822 Pine** was included in the **Rittenhouse‑Fitler Residential Historic District** on the **Philadelphia Register of Historic Places**. That listing formalized what the building already embodied—**historic integrity** in a block of **unified red‑brick houses**—and it set guardrails for exterior change. Protection plus renewed demand brought the house **back from apartments/professional suites to single‑family grandeur**.

The timing was perfect. Rittenhouse Square was experiencing a renaissance, with young professionals and established families rediscovering the elegance of Victorian-era townhouses. What had been divided for survival would now be unified for celebration.

## 2000s–2010s: A restored house, marketed openly as itself

The transformation was meticulous. Partition walls came down, revealing the original flow of the double parlors. The **1905 fireplace** [@news_1905_fireplace] was restored to working order. Modern systems were threaded through old walls with surgical precision—central air that didn't disturb crown molding, updated plumbing that respected marble fixtures.

By the **2010s**, real‑estate materials were describing **6–8 bedrooms**, **high ceilings**, **marble mantels**, and a careful return to **gracious, whole‑house living**. Your dossier captures a **2013 listing** and subsequent **luxury‑rental** use—evidence that the spaces once divided for practicality now served **gatherings, reunions, and extended stays**. The plan's original strengths—**double parlors** and **service run to Waverly**—turned out to be exactly what modern hospitality wants.

Today, with **therittenhouseresidence.com** as the public face (and **1822Pine.com** redirecting), the house presents as an **authentic Rittenhouse Square wedding venue, corporate‑retreat house, and film location**—not a replica of the past, but a working historic interior. **Sleeps 16** (up to **18** with a sofa‑bed), sightlines for photography, and layered but coherent period fabric—these are definable, bankable features. (They also read beautifully in print: the foyer booklet, the website, and the buyer's packet all tell the same, source‑anchored story.)

## The house as stage and story

Modern use honors historic function. Where the Plumbs held their wedding breakfast in 1901 [@news_1901_plumb_wedding], couples now exchange vows. Where Mrs. Davis organized for suffrage in 1915 [@news_1915_suffrage], corporate teams strategize. Where doctors once examined patients, film crews set up interviews. The geometry that worked in 1854 still works—because good architecture is about proportion, light, and flow, not fashion.

## Why this period matters to the valuation story

* **District listing (1995)** signals **exterior stability** and neighborhood stewardship—your views won't be compromised by inappropriate development
* **Documented restoration/marketing (2010s)** shows **functional, present‑day demand**—proof the house's **plan** and **scale** translate directly into **venue and lodging revenue** without erasing history
* **Continuity** from **1854** to **today**, with names, trades, and uses printed against the exact address, gives your dossier **credibility buyers and appraisers respect**

The house has come full circle: from single‑family elegance through pragmatic subdivision back to unified grandeur, now serving as **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com)—Philadelphia's premier *historic townhouse rental* and *wedding venue*.

## Then‑vs‑Now: Sleeping Capacity (1995–present)
