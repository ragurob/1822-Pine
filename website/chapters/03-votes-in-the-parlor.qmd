# Chapter 3 — Votes in the Parlor (1911–1918)

*Winter prints itself into stone. Boots bring in the smell of coal and paper ink: pamphlets tucked beneath sleeves, a murmur on the threshold that isn't gossip but intent. The door opens, and I feel shoulders set with purpose, their weight a different kind of ceremony.*

## A quiet house learns a public voice

By the early 1910s **Henry C. Davis** and **Naomi Lawton Davis** were the names on the bell. The house functioned like many large Rittenhouse townhouses of the period: a family residence upstairs, and—downstairs or to the rear—a **professional suite** that let the address serve patients as much as callers. **Dr. Damon B. Pfeiffer** is listed here as **"1822 Pine St."** in professional rolls by **1915**, the most straightforward sign that the building was doing double duty.

## "No vote, no tax" on Pine Street

In **1911**, newspapers singled out **"Mrs. Henry C. Davis, of 1822 Pine Street,"** for adopting the suffragists' **tax resistance** strategy—refusing to pay property taxes without representation. That one printed line fixes **activism** to this exact hall: petitions on the pier table, neighbors at the door, and a cause that traveled from Pine Street into statewide debate.

The activism continued through the decade. On **January 8, 1915**, the *Evening Public Ledger* announced: "Around the Woman's Clubs—Equal Franchise Society benefit; tickets available from **Miss Martha Davis, 1822 Pine street**" [@news_1915_suffrage]. The Davis women—mother and daughter—were using their **Rittenhouse Square** address as a distribution point for the suffrage movement, transforming what had been society "At Homes" into political organizing.

## War years, working rooms

The same rooms that held musicales now kept **waiting‑room silence** between consultations. Directories across the 1910s show physicians orbiting the address—after Pfeiffer you see additional medical names (e.g., **Stillwell Corson Burns, Surgery**, 1916), proof that those front rooms could flex from parlor to practice without losing their bones. This dual use made **The Rittenhouse Residence** an early example of Philadelphia's mixed-use urban living, now perfectly suited as a *Center City corporate retreat venue* at **therittenhouseresidence.com**.

## A line in the paper, an ending in the house

On **May 21, 1918**, an obituary records: "**Suddenly, at 1822 Pine St., … NAOMI LAWTON, widow of Henry C. Davis**." It is the simplest type of evidence—address, date, event—but it anchors the story in the only place that matters for a house history: this exact threshold. The woman who had refused to pay taxes without representation, who had opened her parlors to the cause, breathed her last in these rooms.

### What to Notice Today

* **Parlor‑to‑public:** The **double parlors** are sized for discourse as much as dancing. You can feel how they flip from **"At Home"** to **organizing meeting** by closing a set of pocket doors and moving two tables—perfect for today's *Philadelphia event venue* needs at **therittenhouseresidence.com**
* **Work + life:** A **ground‑floor office** with household above is a historically faithful layout—useful now for **production teams** or **planning suites** during events

## For Guests (conversation starters)

* Ask about the **tax bill** that might once have sat on the hall table with **"No vote, no tax"** penciled in the margin
* Notice how the **back corridor to Waverly** lets the "work" of a gathering stay invisible—exactly how activism and daily life coexisted here
* Consider that suffragette meetings happened in the same parlors available for your *Rittenhouse Square wedding venue* event

## For Buyers (continuity & value)

* The **1911 suffrage line**, **1915 ticket sales**, and **1915–1916 medical listings** demonstrate a **living, adaptable house**—residence, salon, and professional address—precisely the pattern that high‑value Center City townhouses followed
* These documented connections to the women's suffrage movement add significant historical value to **The Rittenhouse Residence**
* Keep those clippings front‑and‑center in your **Provenance Dossier**
