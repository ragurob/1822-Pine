# Architectural Floor Plans

These floor plans show the current configuration of The Rittenhouse Residence, reflecting both the original 1854 layout and subsequent modifications, including the 1899 Duhring, Okie & Ziegler renovations.

## Understanding the Plans

The house maintains its classic Philadelphia side-hall plan, with formal spaces at the front, service areas to the rear, and the distinctive connection to Waverly Street that has facilitated discrete service access since 1854.

### Key to Reading the Plans

- **Original 1854 elements**: Load-bearing walls, main staircase, room proportions
- **1899 modifications**: Likely bathroom additions, updated service areas
- **Modern updates**: Kitchens, bathrooms, and systems integrated within historic fabric
- **Flow patterns**: Note how the side hall creates clear circulation on each floor

## First Floor - Public Spaces

![First Floor Plan](../images/floor-plans/1822 1 Floor.pdf){width=100%}

### Key Spaces:
- **Entry Hall**: The original side-hall plan that defines circulation
- **Double Parlors**: Connected by pocket doors, site of historic gatherings from 1901 weddings to 1915 suffrage meetings
- **Formal Dining Room**: With French doors to garden
- **Kitchen**: Modern chef's kitchen in historic footprint
- **Service Corridor**: Original path to Waverly Street, still used for catering and events

### Historical Notes:
The first floor plan remains remarkably true to the 1854 original. The double parlors where you see them today hosted the Rolin-Plumb wedding breakfast in 1901 [@news_1901_plumb_wedding] and Mrs. Davis's "At Homes" in 1904 [@news_1904_davis_athome]. The 1905 fireplace [@news_1905_fireplace] is located in the front parlor.
