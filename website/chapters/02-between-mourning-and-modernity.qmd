# Chapter 2 — Between Mourning and Modernity (1891–1905)

*By the 1890s my edges had rounded with callers. Some mornings were a hush, others a parade: a florist's boy with green‑stained fingers; a dressmaker balancing hatboxes like planets. Feet told me everything—slow for sorrow, quick for parties; practical in the rain; resolute when news had to be faced.*

## 1891: A family's grief marks the threshold

Before the house would change hands, tragedy struck. On **April 20, 1891**, seven-year-old **Howard Spencer Jr.**, eldest child of Graham and Agnes Mary Spencer, died of scarlet fever **at 1822 Pine Street** [@news_1891_scarlet_spencer]. The obituary's simple notation—"Interment private"—speaks volumes about Victorian grief. This loss may have precipitated what came next: the rooms too heavy with memory to keep.

## 1893: A new name on the deed; 1896: Another loss

After nearly four decades in the Roset orbit, the house changed hands. In **June 1893** the **Roset estate** (through its trustee) sold **1822 Pine** to **Howard Spencer**, a gentleman of independent means [@deed_1893_abstract]. His time here was brief: **June 28, 1896** finds his obituary closing that chapter; his executors—**Henry S. Pleasants** and **William McLean**—took charge of the estate.

## 1899: A young heiress modernizes

On **April 3, 1899**, the deed passed to **Agnes M. Spencer**, Howard's daughter [@deed_1899_abstract]. Almost immediately she commissioned **Duhring, Okie & Ziegler**—rising stars in tasteful modernization—to undertake **alterations and additions** to the dwelling, a turn‑of‑century refit with new services and refreshed rooms. Contemporary notes put the work squarely at **1822 Pine** under her name.

> *Owner note to verify against permits:* Family memory suggests a **rear extension** and a **back service stair** were part of the 1899 scope. What we can **prove** today is the commission itself—**client, address, architects, and date**—with "alterations and additions" named explicitly.

## 1900s: The house pivots between families

The new century brought a parade of notable residents to **The Rittenhouse Residence**:

**Winter 1901** — *The Philadelphia Times* society column reported: "Mrs. Graham Spencer has closed her country house, at Knolln, Chester county, and **returned to 1822 Pine street for the winter**" [@news_1901_winter_return]—the classic "summer out, winter in" rhythm that defined Rittenhouse Square society.

**Autumn 1901** — By October, **Fayette R. Plumb**, a prominent manufacturer, claimed **1822 Pine** as his residence [@news_1901_plumb_residence]. November brought celebration: a **wedding breakfast at 1822 Pine Street** for the Rolin-Plumb nuptials [@news_1901_plumb_wedding], filling the parlors with joy where grief had so recently dwelt.

**1904** — The **Davis** family emerges as residents. *The Philadelphia Inquirer* announced: "At Home—**Mrs. Henry C. Davis and the Misses Davis, of 1822 Pine street**" [@news_1904_davis_athome]. These choreographed "At Home" afternoons when society ladies received callers would soon evolve into something more radical—suffrage organizing. (Their story continues in the next chapter.)

**1905** — Physical improvements continue. Building permits record: "**J.N. Long, alterations, fireplace, 1822 Pine St.; $130**" [@news_1905_fireplace]—about $4,500 today, a telling investment in both comfort and property value.

By the first decade's end, directories and professional rolls show **Dr. Damon B. Pfeiffer, M.D.** at **1822 Pine**, a pattern common in large Center‑City houses: **professional suite below, household above**. The address reappears in **1915** College of Physicians listings, confirming a sustained practice at the house—making it an early example of Philadelphia's mixed-use urban living, now perfectly suited as a *Center City corporate retreat venue* at **therittenhouseresidence.com**.

## How the rooms worked, c. 1899–1905

* **Technology & texture.** Gas mantels brightened; plumbing improved; wallpapers and woodwork refreshed under DO&Z. The front rooms stayed ceremonial, the rear axis did the work.
* **Social season.** **Winters in town** meant "At Homes," musicales, wedding breakfasts—the double parlors earning their keep as they do today for *Rittenhouse Square event rentals*.
* **Staffing.** Roles sharpened: **cook**, **parlor maid**, **laundress**, perhaps a **boy** for errands. The new century expected more polish and more privacy; a **back stair** (if added) enforced both.

### What to Notice Today

* **The 1905 fireplace** — Still warming the parlor where Mrs. Davis held her "At Homes," where the Plumb wedding breakfast was served in 1901.
* **Ceremonial scale** — The parlor pair was made for gatherings—a **micro‑wedding** or **board dinner** feels *right* here because the proportions were literally designed to host them.
* **Work/life overlay** — A private office suite on the ground floor coexists naturally with family quarters above—useful for today's **production teams** and **off‑site facilitators** at **therittenhouseresidence.com**.
