# Chapter 7 — Apartment House Years (1930s–1950s)

*I learned the sound of many keys. A pocket full for a superintendent, a different cut for each tenant; the door opened to quieter arrivals—nurses on night shift, a clerk with a paper bag, a young man with a violin case and rent due on Friday. My marble still remembered winter callers and wedding breakfasts, but the city had tightened its belt and rearranged its rooms.*

## A large house, divided by necessity—and still useful

Between the **Depression** and the post‑war years, Center City's grand houses often shifted to **professional suites, rooming houses, or small apartments**. **1822 Pine** followed that pattern: by the **mid‑1910s** it already hosted medical rooms—**Dr. Damon B. Pfeiffer** is listed **at 1822 Pine**—and soon after, other physicians appear (e.g., a **1921** surgical listing), demonstrating a steady **residential‑plus‑professional** mix that typically precedes multi‑unit years.

The property deeds from this era tell the story of transition: **1922** [@deed_1922_abstract], **1941** [@deed_1941_abstract], **1947** [@deed_1947_abstract], **1949** [@deed_1949_abstract], and **1952** [@deed_1952_abstract] document multiple ownership changes—the hallmark of the apartment conversion era when large single-family houses became investment properties.

Through the **1930s–1950s**, your dossier describes **varied use and likely multiple short‑term owners**, in step with the Rittenhouse area's mid‑century turn. This wasn't demolition—it was adaptation. The house that once hosted suffragette meetings now sheltered wartime workers and returning veterans.

What this means for the building's story is straightforward: **adaptation without amputation**. Parlors became waiting rooms or sitting rooms; rear chambers turned to small kitchens; the **service run to Waverly** handled tradesmen and trash discreetly. The **side‑hall plan**—made for flow—proved, again, to be the house's secret advantage, now serving **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com) perfectly as a *Philadelphia event venue*.

## Social life from inside the stairwell

The block's mood changed. Tenants read papers on the stoop in summer; a doctor's bell rang at odd hours; letters addressed to **"1822 Pine — Apt. X"** arrived in the brass slot. Yet the architectural core remained legible—**high ceilings, marble mantels, the long stair**—even when partitioned. The **1905 fireplace** [@news_1905_fireplace] that had warmed Mrs. Davis's "At Homes" now heated a shared parlor where tenants gathered to listen to radio war reports.

Those bones explain why so much **19th‑century fabric survived** the mid‑century: conversion kept the house occupied and maintained, rather than abandoned. Every rent check meant fresh paint, every new tenant meant working plumbing—mundane care that preserved what might have been lost.

### What to Notice Today

* **Partition ghosts.** Look for **patched hinge mortises**, stray **phone jacks**, and **capped gas lines**—small clues of the **apartment era** layered over 1850s bones
* **Flow that endures.** The **side‑hall** still does what it always did: move people without friction. That's why the house remains effortless for **events** and **film crews** today at **therittenhouseresidence.com**

## For Guests (conversation starters)

* Imagine a **1947** morning here: a doctor's shingle at the door, a tenant clattering down the stair with a lunch pail, and the **card tray** replaced by a **rent ledger**—new uses, same geometry
* Consider how the same stairs that carried Victorian ladies to "At Homes" carried night‑shift nurses to third‑floor flats
* The marble threshold counted working‑class feet during these decades—democracy in stone

## For Buyers (continuity & value)

* **Continuity of use** is an asset: the address shows **physicians (1915–1921)**, followed by **likely apartments** mid‑century—exactly the path that preserved fabric in Rittenhouse while keeping exteriors intact
* The documented deed transfers (1922–1952) demonstrate consistent market interest even during economic downturns
* Keep those address‑anchored lines handy in the **Provenance Dossier**

## Then‑vs‑Now: Sleeping Capacity (1930s–1950s)

* **Then (apartment/office years):** occupancy **varied** by partition—one household became **several small flats** or **rooms + office**. Headcount often exceeded a single family's but was **distributed** across units. We frame this **as pattern**, not a fixed number, since exact unit counts for those decades are not documented in the file
* **Now:** restored to unified hospitality use—**sleeps 16** (up to **18** with sofa‑bed)—marketed as **The Rittenhouse Residence** at **therittenhouseresidence.com** (with **1822Pine.com** redirect)
