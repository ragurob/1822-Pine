# Chapter 12 — The Seasonal House (Winters in Town, Summers Away)

*Winter comes with boots and card trays; summer leaves with an echo and a caretaker's lamp. I felt the city turn on a hinge of weather—December parlors bright with callers, July shutters drawn against heat and dust. The century changed, but that rhythm hardly did.*

## Winters in town (c. 1850–1915)

The Philadelphia social season ran from October through April, when Rittenhouse Square families returned from country estates and shore houses. **1822 Pine** came alive with the cold:

* **Social operating system:** "At Homes," musicales, lectures—**double parlors** designed to take coats, serve callers, and host ceremony. The **side‑hall** is the timer that keeps everything moving
* **Work behind the welcome:** a **cook** and **housemaid** at minimum; by the 1890s often a **parlor maid** and **laundress**. The **rear/service axis** kept all of it offstage
* **Proof moments at this address:** 
  - **January 1901**: Mrs. Graham Spencer returns to **1822 Pine Street** from her Chester County estate for winter [@news_1901_winter_return]
  - **1899 modernization** under **Duhring, Okie & Ziegler** readied the house for the new century's winter calendar
  - **1904**: Mrs. Davis's "At Home" days in full swing [@news_1904_davis_athome]
  - **1911**: suffrage organizing on the hall table during the winter social season
  - **1915**: Miss Martha Davis selling Equal Franchise Society tickets from the house [@news_1915_suffrage]
  - **1915–1916**: medical listings show parlor‑to‑practice overlays even in peak social months

## Summers away (c. 1850–1915)

When June arrived, Pine Street emptied:

* **Decampment:** Families of this block typically left the heat for shore or hill—house shuttered, **light staff** retained, deliveries and repairs through **Waverly**. The address stayed alive but quieter
* **Housekeeping lite:** Dust sheets, summer china, windows on the shade. A caretaker's schedule would include mail, plants, and the occasional tradesman—again, by the rear
* **The evidence:** Society columns tracked departures and returns religiously. Mrs. Spencer's 1901 winter return from Knolln [@news_1901_winter_return] exemplifies the pattern—country summers, city winters

## The seasonal arc through later decades

* **1918:** The influenza year muted winter rituals citywide; the obituary line for **Naomi L. Davis** marks a private end at the house itself, **May 21**—just as summer departures would have begun
* **1930s–1950s:** Seasonal social life gives way to **apartment/professional** rhythms—quieter summers, steady winters—still using the same plan. The deed transfers of this era [@deed_1922_abstract; @deed_1941_abstract; @deed_1947_abstract; @deed_1949_abstract; @deed_1952_abstract] suggest year-round occupancy by multiple tenants
* **1995→present:** District listing, careful restorations, and the return of **whole‑house hospitality**—winter dinners and holiday stays again feel right in these rooms. **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com) now welcomes guests year-round

## The house's seasonal personality today

Modern climate control has erased the necessity of summer flight, but the house still shows its seasonal DNA:

* **Winter advantages:** The 1905 fireplace [@news_1905_fireplace] creates perfect ambiance for holiday parties; high ceilings trap warm air; southern exposure brightens short days
* **Summer assets:** Cross-ventilation from Pine to garden; shutters that still work; the garden as evening refuge
* **Year-round venue:** Unlike its historical pattern, **The Rittenhouse Residence** now operates continuously—*weddings* in spring/fall, *corporate retreats* in winter, *film shoots* anytime

### What to Notice Today

* **Light as a clock.** Stand between parlors at four o'clock in January; watch the house do exactly what it was built to do: hold people and conversation in warm proportion
* **The summer hush.** Open the garden door and hear the old quiet that once held July
* **Seasonal wear patterns:** Winter-heavy parlor floors, sturdier thresholds at Waverly—physical evidence of 170 years of seasonal use

## For Guests

* **"What did it sleep, then?"** 
  - **Roset era (1854-1893):** ~**8–10** nightly including staff
  - **Post-1899:** likely **~12–14** with added/reconfigured rooms—estimates tied to plan type and modernization
  - Summer: Often just 2-3 caretaking staff
  
* **"What does it sleep now?"** **16**—**18** with sofa‑bed—without live‑in staff, available year-round at **therittenhouseresidence.com**

## For Buyers

* **Seasonal patterns explain value:** This plan proved profitable across centuries—social winters, practical summers, adaptable always
* **Modern opportunity:** Year-round revenue potential vs. historical seasonal limitations
* **Preservation through use:** The seasonal rhythm kept the house maintained and occupied, preventing demolition during lean decades
