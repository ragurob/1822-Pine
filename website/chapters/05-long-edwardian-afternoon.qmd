# Chapter 5 — The Long Edwardian Afternoon (1905–1925)

*I learned new noises. The tick of a telephone. The quick, bright chime of a bicycle bell outside. The faint, clean sting of carbolic following patients in from Pine. In winter I felt the crowding of coats and purpose; in summer my stone was warm and the key turned only now and then, a caretaker's step like a whisper.*

## A house between salon and surgery

By the first decade of the century, Pine Street's grande dames learned to do more than pour tea. **1822 Pine** became a place where the front rooms could host callers at four and patients at five, the household running upstairs in its old rhythm while a professional suite took shape below. The medical rosters of the period fix the reality with busy, practical lines: **"Dr. Damon B. Pfeiffer — 1822 Pine St."** appears in the College of Physicians roll by **1915**, and a **1916** register adds **"Stillwell Corson Burns — Surgery, 1822 Pine St."**—proof that the building wore a physician's shingle as easily as a calling card.

## The Davises: a public conscience in private rooms

Down this hall walked **Naomi Lawton Davis**, **"Mrs. Henry C. Davis, of 1822 Pine Street,"** who in **1911** made the papers by refusing to pay taxes without a vote. It is only a sentence, but it plants suffrage squarely on this doorstep; imagine the pamphlets on the pier table and the neighbors at the bell.

The activism continued through the family. On **January 8, 1915**, the *Evening Public Ledger* announced: "Around the Woman's Clubs—Equal Franchise Society benefit; tickets available from **Miss Martha Davis, 1822 Pine street**" [@news_1915_suffrage]. Mother and daughter transformed what had been genteel "At Homes" into political organizing—the parlors pivoting from tea service to ticket distribution.

**May 21, 1918** brings a short and sober notice: **"Suddenly, at 1822 Pine St., … NAOMI LAWTON, widow of Henry C. Davis."** A period at the end of a life—and the end of an era for this address.

## City winters, lighter summers

The old pattern held. Winters in town: musicales, "At Homes," and now appointment hours; summers: drawn blinds, reduced staff, a caretaker's routine. The plan—the side‑hall with paired parlors and a service run to Waverly—made both modes efficient and discreet. This seasonal rhythm, documented as early as **1901** when Mrs. Graham Spencer returned from Chester County for winter [@news_1901_winter_return], defined Philadelphia society life.

## Work behind the hospitality

Service in these years sharpened into roles: **cook**, **parlor maid**, **laundress**, an **errand boy** or **handyman**. The probable back‑of‑house stair remembered in family notes would have enforced privacy between clients and household (a detail we publish cautiously until permit pages confirm it; what we can prove today is the **1899 "alterations & additions"** commission that modernized the house).

### What to Notice Today

* **Parlors that pivot.** Close the pocket doors and the front room becomes a waiting room while the second parlor hosts family—historic flexibility that still serves intimate events and production workrooms at **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com)
* **Professional traces.** Look for where a placard or shingle could have hung just inside the door; the records place physicians at this address through the mid‑1910s
* **The 1905 fireplace** [@news_1905_fireplace] that warmed both social calls and medical consultations

## For Guests (conversation starters)

* **"No vote, no tax."** That stance started on this hall table; ask who turned up at the bell and what the arguments sounded like in these parlors
* **A doctor's day in 1915.** Imagine the smell of antiseptic, the muffled tick of a wall clock, and a neat schedule pinned beside the mantel
* **Suffrage tickets.** Miss Martha Davis distributed Equal Franchise Society tickets from this very hall—transforming society connections into political action

## For Buyers (continuity & value)

* **Address‑anchored evidence**—1911 suffrage line, 1915 ticket sales [@news_1915_suffrage], 1915–1916 medical listings, 1918 obituary at the house—demonstrates a property that adapted gracefully without losing its ceremonial core
* These are ideal **Provenance Dossier** pins for a valuation narrative
* The dual use as residence and professional space prefigures today's mixed‑use appeal at **therittenhouseresidence.com**

## Then‑vs‑Now: Sleeping Capacity (1905–1925)

* **Then (working estimate):** with modernized services post‑1899 and likely re‑use of rear rooms, routine capacity ~12–14 including staff, peaking to ~16 at holidays. We present this as a careful estimate until permit drawings confirm exact room counts
* **Now:** sleeps **16** (up to **18** with a sofa‑bed), presented on **therittenhouseresidence.com** (with **1822Pine.com** redirect) for *weddings*, *reunions*, *corporate off‑sites*, and *filming*
