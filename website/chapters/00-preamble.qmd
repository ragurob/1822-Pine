# Preamble

**Welcome.** You're standing in a long, brick memory. The house at **1822 Pine St., Philadelphia, PA 19103** has watched the city's moods for nearly two centuries—winters in town when the parlors filled with "At Homes," summers gone out of the city with shutters half‑latched and a caretaker's lamp burning late. It has hosted merchants and reformers, doctors and debutantes, and the quiet courage of those who kept the rooms turning: cooks, maids, a coachman once, later a laundress and a parlor maid.

This is **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com), where Philadelphia's history lives in every room—available as a *Rittenhouse Square historic townhouse rental*, *Philadelphia event venue*, and *Center City film location*.

## How to use this book

* **If you're an owner or buyer:** skim the *Provenance* sidebars and the compact dossier at each chapter's end. Every entry is tied to this exact address through deeds, directories, or newspaper notices. For example: **1854**—developer **John McCrea** sells the newly built house to **John Roset**; **1899**—**Agnes M. Spencer** commissions **Duhring, Okie & Ziegler** to modernize; **1915**—**Miss Martha Davis** sells Equal Franchise Society tickets from **1822 Pine**; **May 21, 1918**—**Naomi Lawton Davis** dies suddenly **at the house**.

* **If you're a guest or planning an event:** read the opening "doorstep" paragraph of each chapter and the *What to Notice Today* bullets—you'll have lively, true stories to tell over dinner or during a walk to **Rittenhouse Square**.

* **If you're scouting a venue or film location:** the scale of the front rooms, the service corridor to **Waverly Street**, and the house's layered authenticity are your best assets. Visit **therittenhouseresidence.com** for availability.
