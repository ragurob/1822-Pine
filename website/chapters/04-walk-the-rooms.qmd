# Chapter 4 — Walk the Rooms: A Self‑Guided Tour

*I have a map of you—made of thresholds. The first step lifts you off Pine Street and into the side‑hall current. Turn right for ceremony, left for work, upward for rest, outward for errands toward Waverly. Follow it, and you'll read the same plan thousands of feet have followed before you.*

> **How to use this chapter:** read the short note for each space, then look for the detail that proves the line—hinge scars, a service passage, the way light pools in the second parlor at four o'clock. Where we cite, we cite to this address.

## 1) The Marble Stoop & Threshold

A Philadelphia signature. The **white marble** step took iron‑rimmed wheels, salt, and the bristles of a housemaid's broom. It is the "narrator" of the building—measuring hours by arrivals. This same step welcomed the Rosets in 1854, witnessed Howard Spencer Jr.'s final return in 1891, and felt the determined tread of suffragettes in 1915. (Your dossier opens with this as the physical symbol of a mid‑19th‑century **Rittenhouse** townhouse.)

## 2) Side Hall (the city's conveyor belt)

The long hall is **logistics in brick**: card tray during **"At Homes,"** umbrellas and overcoats in winter, a quiet passage for staff and—today—**caterers and crews** at **The Rittenhouse Residence** (therittenhouseresidence.com). The plan is made for flow, not fuss.

## 3) Double Parlors (ceremony & discourse)

Two rooms in a line, doors pocketing away. Imagine a **wedding breakfast** laid end‑to‑end (as at the Rolin-Plumb celebration in 1901 [@news_1901_plumb_wedding]), or a suffrage circle set facing (Miss Martha Davis's Equal Franchise Society gatherings, 1915 [@news_1915_suffrage]). The **1899 alterations** under **Duhring, Okie & Ziegler** likely refreshed finishes and services here; what we can prove is the commission itself—**client, address, architects, and date**.

The **1905 fireplace** installed by J.N. Long for $130 [@news_1905_fireplace] still warms the front parlor—the same hearth where Mrs. Davis held her "At Homes" in 1904 [@news_1904_davis_athome].

> **Owner note (to verify):** family memory of a **rear extension** and **back stair** fits the era's patterns; confirmable via **permits** or the **Real Estate Record & Builders' Guide** pages cited in your dossier. Until then, present this as "probable configuration" grounded in the 1899 **alterations & additions** line.

## 4) Dining Room & Rear Corridor

Hospitality happens here—doors to the **garden**, the **service run to Waverly**, and the back‑of‑house logic that keeps a dinner seamless. (The lot is **22 ft x 90 ft**, running to **Waverly Street**; the geometry still governs load‑in/out and quiet staff circulation for your *Philadelphia event venue* needs.)

## 5) Kitchen (work that made the house sing)

Once coal and copper, later gas and enameled iron. A **cook and housemaid** would have done most of the daily labor; by the 1900s a **parlor maid** and **laundress** were common in houses of this scale. The plan still supports that choreography today—only the tools have changed, now perfect for catering your *Rittenhouse Square wedding venue* events at **therittenhouseresidence.com**.

## 6) Stairhall (the spine)

Stand at the turn and look down into the hall and up into the light. The stair tells you the social logic: **public** on the ground, **semi‑public** in the front chambers, **private** above and to the rear. These same stairs carried the grief of 1891, the hope of suffrage organizers, and today carry guests to their rooms at **The Rittenhouse Residence**.

## 7) Chambers (then & now)

### Then (c. 1855–1905):
* Principal rooms on the **second floor**
* Children and guests **third**
* **Servants** tucked in the **rear** or **attic**
* Regular sleeping **8–10** in the Roset era, rising to **~12–14** after 1899 if a rear addition increased rooms—best stated today as a **cautious, evidence‑based estimate** pending permits

### Now:
* **Sleeps 16** comfortably (**18** with a sofa‑bed)
* Marketed as **The Rittenhouse Residence**—a **Rittenhouse Square wedding venue** and **large‑group townhouse rental** at **therittenhouseresidence.com**
* Perfect for *Philadelphia corporate retreats*, *family reunions*, and *film production housing*

## 8) Garden & Waverly

Behind the brick is the **service world**: historically a **stable/coach** opening on **Waverly**; today, discreet vendor access and a buffer for events. The block's endurance—unified red‑brick façades front, service to the rear—is why these houses still **work** as *Center City event venues*.

## 9) The Office Suite (c. 1907–1916)

If you use a ground‑floor room as a **production office** or **client lounge**, you're reenacting the house's own adaptation. Medical registers plant **Dr. Damon B. Pfeiffer** here by **1915**, and additional physician listings follow (e.g., **Stillwell Corson Burns** in **1916**), proving the parlor‑as‑practice pattern—now ideal for *Philadelphia corporate retreat* headquarters at **therittenhouseresidence.com**.

## 10) Roof & Later Touches

A **roof deck** is a modern amenity in the neighborhood (kept discrete from the street view under historic‑district rules). Interior woodwork and mantels show a **19th‑century core** with **turn‑of‑century refresh**—the very blend your 2010s real‑estate materials celebrated.

## A note on tone and truth

Where we speculate (rear extension; staff stair), we say so and point to the **next document to find**. Where the record prints **"1822 Pine Street"**, we build on that line and nothing else. This is how a house earns trust as a **venue**, a **stay**, and an **heirloom**—by letting its own paper trail do the talking.

Visit **therittenhouseresidence.com** to experience this living history as your *Rittenhouse Square historic townhouse rental*, *Philadelphia wedding venue*, or *Center City corporate retreat*.
