## Preservation Philosophy

### What's Been Preserved
- All original architectural fabric possible
- Room proportions and circulation patterns
- Character-defining features (mantels, moldings, floors)
- Façade integrity and streetscape contribution

### Sensitive Modernization
- **HVAC**: Carefully routed to minimize impact
- **Electrical**: Updated while preserving plaster
- **Plumbing**: Modern fixtures in period-appropriate styles
- **Kitchen**: Professional equipment in traditional cabinet\n- **Technology**: WiFi/cable discretely integrated

### Historic District Standards
As a contributing structure to the Rittenhouse-Fitler Historic District:
- Exterior modifications require Historical Commission review
- Windows must maintain historic configuration
- Façade cleaning/repointing must use appropriate methods
- Roofing must be slate or approved substitute
