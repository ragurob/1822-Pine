## More Than a House, It's a Witness to History

Since 1854, this house has stood sentinel, watching Philadelphia transform. It was born in the industrial fervor of the Victorian era, came of age during the fight for women's suffrage, and hosted the city's elite during the Gilded Age. It has been a home, a doctor's office, a society hub, and a silent witness to the intimate dramas of the families within its walls.

This isn't just a rental; it's an invitation to become part of that story.
