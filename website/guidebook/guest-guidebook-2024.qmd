## The House Story

### A Living Timeline
**1854**: Built by developer John McCrea, first owned by the Roset family  
**1891**: The Spencer era begins amid both tragedy and transformation  
**1899**: Modernized by architects Duhring, Okie & Ziegler  
**1901**: Society weddings and winter "At Homes" fill the parlors  
**1905**: The fireplace you'll enjoy tonight was installed  
**1911-1915**: Suffragette meetings held in these very rooms  
**1995**: Protected as part of Rittenhouse-Fitler Historic District  
**Today**: Your chapter in this continuing story

### What Makes This Special
The double parlors where you'll gather for breakfast once hosted Victorian weddings and suffragette strategy sessions. The marble threshold you cross counted calling cards in the 1890s. The service corridor to Waverly Street that your breakfast delivery uses once brought coal and ice. Every room has a story—ask us about your suite's history!
