## Historical Notes on Current Use

The current configuration honors the house's original 1854 plan while adapting to modern hospitality:

- **Double parlors**: Maintain their ceremonial function (weddings then and now)
- **Service corridor to Waverly**: Still used for discrete vendor access
- **Suite locations**: Follow original family/guest/servant hierarchy
- **Kitchen placement**: Maintains historic service flow

Each suite is named to reflect either its historical use (Library, Mansion) or its geographical orientation (Pine Street, Waverly Street), connecting guests to the property's rich history while enjoying modern comfort.
