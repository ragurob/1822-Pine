## What You Can't Put a Price On

::: {.benefit-grid}
::: {.benefit-card}
### Everyone Under One Roof
No coordinating between hotel rooms. Share breakfast together, gather in the parlors, enjoy late-night conversations. Create actual memories as a group.
:::

::: {.benefit-card}
### Cook Together
Full professional kitchen means you can have group breakfasts, cook family recipes, or bring in a private chef for a fraction of restaurant costs.
:::

::: {.benefit-card}
### Kids Can Be Kids
Parents can relax in the parlors while kids play upstairs. No worrying about noise complaints from neighboring hotel rooms. Real family time.
:::

::: {.benefit-card}
### Host Meetings Your Way
Corporate groups: spread out in the dining room for meetings, use the parlors for breakouts, take calls from private suites. Work on your schedule.
:::

::: {.benefit-card}
### The Stories You'll Tell
"Remember when we stayed in that mansion where suffragettes met?" beats "Remember that Holiday Inn?"
:::

::: {.benefit-card}
### Flexibility & Freedom
Eat when you want, come and go as you please, use the washer, spread out your stuff. Live like you're at home, not in a hotel.

## Real Guest Comparisons

> "We priced out the Four Seasons for our family reunion—16 people, 3 nights. It would have cost $15,000+ and we'd still be separated into rooms. For $9,000 we got this entire historic mansion, created our own schedule, cooked breakfasts together, and made memories we'll never forget. Not even close."
>
> **— Sarah M., Family Reunion Host**

> "Our company usually books conference hotels for offsites. This was half the price and 10x better. The team actually bonded instead of disappearing to separate hotel rooms. We're never going back to the old way."
>
> **— David R., Tech Company VP**

> "We almost booked hotel rooms for our wedding party. I'm so glad we found this instead. Having everyone together the night before the wedding, getting ready together in the suites, having brunch together that morning—it made the weekend so much more special than scattered across a hotel."
>
> **— Emily & James, Wedding Couple**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is it really cheaper than hotels for our group?**
A: For 8+ people, almost always yes. [Contact us](contact.qmd) with your dates and group size for an exact comparison.

**Q: What if we're fewer than 16 people?**
A: Still a great value! Even for 8 people, you get way more space and amenities than 4 hotel rooms, often for the same or less money.

**Q: Can we have catering or events?**
A: Yes! Small gatherings with overnight guests are welcome. See our [house rules](house-rules.qmd) for details.

**Q: How does payment work?**
A: Book through [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6000930) or [VRBO](https://www.vrbo.com/757481) with their standard payment protection. Or [book direct](contact.qmd) and save an additional 5%.

**Q: What about cleaning?**
A: One-time $450 cleaning fee vs. nightly hotel fees. And you're not living in a space someone else slept in the night before.
