## I. HIGH-PROBABILITY ARCHIVES (Click to Search)

### 1. PhillyHistory.org (City Archives)
*Best for streetscape views. The city photographed every intersection.*
*   **[Search: "1800 Pine"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:phillyhistory.org+%221800+Pine%22)** - Look for the block face.
*   **[Search: "18th and Pine"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:phillyhistory.org+%2218th+and+Pine%22)** - Corner views often capture the row.
*   **[Search: "19th and Pine"](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:phillyhistory.org+%2219th+and+Pine%22)** - Looking east towards the property.

### 2. Greater Philadelphia GeoHistory Network
*Best for verifying the footprint (stable/coach house).*
*   **[1895 Bromley Atlas](https://www.philageohistory.org/rdic-images/view-image.cfm/BRM1895.Phila.006.Plate06)** - Shows the property footprint during the Spencer era.
*   **[1910 Bromley Atlas](https://www.philageohistory.org/rdic-images/view-image.cfm/BRM1910.Phila.006.Plate06)** - Shows the footprint after the 1899 renovation (look for rear extensions).

### 3. The Athenaeum of Philadelphia (Architectural Archives)
*Best for the "Holy Grail" 1899 renovation photos.*
*   **[Catalog Search: "Duhring, Okie & Ziegler"](https://aeon.athena.org/Logon?Action=10&Form=10)** - You must register to view, but they hold the papers of this firm.
*   **[American Architect & Building News (1899)](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%22American+Architect+and+Building+News%22+1899)** - Search inside these volumes for "Pine Street" or "Spencer".

### 4. Library of Congress (HABS)
*Historic American Buildings Survey often photographed Rittenhouse district.*
*   **[Search: "Pine Street Philadelphia"](https://www.loc.gov/photos/?q=pine+street+philadelphia)** - Browse for 1800 block context.

## II. SPECIFIC VISUAL TARGETS

### Target A: The "Coach House" Verification
*   **Context:** You mentioned a service corridor to Waverly.
*   **Action:** Check the **1895 Bromley Atlas** link above.
*   **What to look for:** Does the lot at 1822 extend all the way to Waverly St? Is there a separate structure (yellow or pink box) at the rear? This confirms the "Coach House" narrative.

### Target B: The 1905 Fireplace
*   **Context:** The $130 fireplace installation.
*   **Action:** Search **[Mercer Tile Catalog](https://www.google.com/search?q=mercer+tiles+catalog+1905&tbm=isch)**.
*   **Why:** If your fireplace matches these patterns, it is a Henry Chapman Mercer original (Moravian Pottery), which adds significant value to the "Architecture" page.

### Target C: The "Apartment House" Signage (1940s)
*   **Context:** The property was a multi-unit rental.
*   **Action:** Search **[Temple University Urban Archives](https://library.temple.edu/collections/scrc/urban-archives)** for "Pine Street Boarding Houses".
*   **Why:** Finding a photo of the house with a "Rooms for Rent" sign would visually anchor Chapter 07.
