# IMPORTANT: Check GitHub Pages Settings

## Go to: https://github.com/ragurob/1822-Pine/settings/pages

### Verify these settings:

1. **Source**: Should be set to "GitHub Actions" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - If it's set to "Deploy from a branch", change it to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Custom domain**: Should be empty (unless you have your own domain)

3. **Enforce HTTPS**: Should be checked ✓

## The Problem Might Be:

If GitHub Pages is set to "Deploy from a branch" instead of "GitHub Actions", it will:
- Ignore our workflow deployments
- Look for files in a branch (usually gh-pages or main)
- Result in 404 errors even though the workflow says "success"

## To Fix:

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Change Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save
4. Re-run the workflow
